# 100 Days of CUDA 
Hey everyone! I will document my 100 days of CUDA challenge in this repo. 
The book I am using to study is PMPP (Parallel Programming and Optimization) book. 

I will be using the following 120 day curriculum as structure inspiration: https://github.com/AdepojuJeremy/Cuda-120-Days-Challenge/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file

| Day           | Summary of Tasks  |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Day 1 (1-27-25)         |   |



If you are feeling inspired or want to join the challenge I highly encourage anyone to join Umar Jamil's amazing discord: https://discord.gg/pdAXevJs
