# 100_day_CUDA
I will document my 100 days of CUDA challenge in this repo. 
The book I am using to study is PMPP (Parallel Programming and Optimization) book. 
I will be using the following 120 day curriculum as structure inspiration: https://github.com/AdepojuJeremy/Cuda-120-Days-Challenge/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file

| Day           | Task Summary  |
